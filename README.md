# frauds-still-happen
Financial Fraud still happens around us. 

Fraud can start with a simple-looking [email](https://github.com/rks101/frauds-still-happen/blob/main/aos_1.pdf) in your mailbox. See the uploaded files here.   

Be aware of such emails (aos_1.pdf). Financial frauds still happen. How do we deal with such issues?   

a) When you look carefully, see the mis-spellings (downlaod) and occasionally capitalized letters in the text. Is it suspicious?   
b) When you hover the cursor over Downlaod All or View link (DO NOT CLICK), see the URL shown below tiyashoes.in near the browser status bar. Is it suspicious?    
c) You can search "Vaishali Exports scammer" or check on the website aakashfinancial.com mentioned in the email at: https://sites.ipaddress.com/aakashfinancial.com.  Is it suspicious?    
d) Sender's name (From name) can be any name in an email. Look at from where the email is coming and who has signed it. Notice mailed-by and signed-by fields in the email header by clicking on the triangle icon just below from an email.  

Action Items for us:   
1. DO NOT CLICK suspicious links or download suspicious attachments.   
2. Mark such emails as Spam and delete them.   
3. One should stay away from shortcuts for money.
