# frauds-still-happen
Financial Fraud still happens around us. They can result in monetary loss and spoil the peace of mind. How do we detect and deal with such fraudulent issues in digital space?   

## Email/message as Spam    

_Email has been a honeypot for fraud for a fairly long time._ Fraud can start with a simple-looking [email message](https://github.com/rks101/frauds-still-happen/blob/main/aos_1.pdf) in your mailbox. See the uploaded files in this repository. This can be triggered on user messaging apps such as SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc., usually with a link. Fraudsters can harvest emails and mobile numbers in bulk from several online/offline sources and spray messages with one of these attack vectors.    

Be aware of such emails (see sample aos_1.pdf) promising quick gains, asking to confirm financial transactions or bank account details - including OTP/PIN and details printed on the cards. Financial fraud still happens through email or Spam. How do we deal with such issues?   

a) When you look carefully, see the mis-spellings (downlaod) and occasionally capitalized letters in the email/message text. Is it suspicious?   

b) When you hover the cursor over "Downlaod All" or "View" link (DO NOT CLICK), see the URL shown below tiyashoes.in near the browser status bar. Is it suspicious?    

c) You can search "Vaishali Exports scammer" or check on the website aakashfinancial.com mentioned in the email at: https://sites.ipaddress.com/aakashfinancial.com.  Is it suspicious?    

d) Sender's name (From name) can be any name in an email. Look at from where the email is coming (origin) and who has signed it. Notice mailed-by and signed-by fields in the email header by clicking on the triangle icon just below an email address.   

Action Items for us:   
1. DO NOT CLICK suspicious links or download suspicious attachments from emails/user messaging apps.   
2. Mark such emails or messages as Spam and delete them. On mobile, you can block unknown and unsubscribed senders spamming your device.    
3. One should avoid shortcuts for money, alluring messages for quick monetary gains.

6. Messages can be for a lottery, a holiday package, or imposters for banking services.     

## SIM Swap   

Due to upgrading to 3G / 4G / 5G services for telephony, one may require a new SIM card. Under SIM swap fraud, fraudsters get a new SIM card issued against one's registered mobile number (RMN) via the mobile service provider using a confirmation OTP sent on to RMN.    

Action Items for us:   
1. Change SIM only at authorized stores of service provider in your own presence.    
2. Opt for e-SIM if you can.
3. If you notice any transaction, immediately report to the bank and telecom service provider.
