# frauds-still-happen
Financial Fraud still happens around us. They can result in monetary loss and spoil the peace of mind. How do we detect and deal with such fraudulent issues in digital space?   

**Email has been a honeypot for fraud for a fairly long time.**   
Fraud can start with a simple-looking [email](https://github.com/rks101/frauds-still-happen/blob/main/aos_1.pdf) in your mailbox. See the uploaded files in this repository.   

Be aware of such emails (sample aos_1.pdf) promising quick gains, asking to confirm financial transactions or bank account details, including OTP/PIN and details printed on the cards. Financial fraud still happens through email or Spam. How do we deal with such issues?   

a) When you look carefully, see the mis-spellings (downlaod) and occasionally capitalized letters in the email/message text. Is it suspicious?   

b) When you hover the cursor over "Downlaod All" or "View" link (DO NOT CLICK), see the URL shown below tiyashoes.in near the browser status bar. Is it suspicious?    

c) You can search "Vaishali Exports scammer" or check on the website aakashfinancial.com mentioned in the email at: https://sites.ipaddress.com/aakashfinancial.com.  Is it suspicious?    

d) Sender's name (From name) can be any name in an email. Look at from where the email is coming (origin) and who has signed it. Notice mailed-by and signed-by fields in the email header by clicking on the triangle icon just below an email address.   

Action Items for us:   
1. DO NOT CLICK suspicious links or download suspicious attachments.   
2. Mark such emails as Spam and delete them.   
3. One should stay away from shortcuts for money.
4. Know more about Spam [here]().
